# React-Portfolio

## Desciption

I created a one-page react portfolio so that employers will be able to see my work, my resume, and be able to reach out. I wanted to show off my skills using `React.js` so that employers can decide if I am a good canidate or not. It solves the problem of having to scroll through a long webpage trying to see its different components. I have it designed so that every component has its own page with the desired fields being displayed. I learned how to properly use props inside of other elements, and how to deploy to gh-pages working on this project.

## Installation

This is a react app so I first had to run `npx create-react-app react-portfolio` so that I could initialize it as a react app. Then I installed all dependecies for bootstrap and its icons. Finally I depolyed this to gh-pages by running `npm i gh-pages` and running the script `npm run deploy`.
